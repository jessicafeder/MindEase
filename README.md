# MindEase

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

MindEase is a chatbot that performs quick, daily check-ins using natural language processing (NLP) to monitor mental health trends and offer personalized support suggestions (like journaling, walking, or reaching out to a therapist). It’s like a mood diary with an empathetic twist.


## Background

Mental health issues such as anxiety and depression are increasingly common, especially among students and remote workers. Yet, many people don’t seek professional help due to stigma, lack of time, or cost. Personally, I’ve experienced how difficult it can be to recognize burnout before it gets overwhelming. MindEase aims to be a non-judgmental, private space for reflection; a gentle first step toward mental well-being.


## How is it used?

	•	Used by: Individuals looking to improve self-awareness and mental resilience. Could be integrated into Slack, Discord, or as a mobile app.
	•	Impacted users: Students, remote workers, and anyone needing a daily reflection moment. Ideally, it empowers people to spot emotional patterns before they escalate.


## Data sources and AI methods
	•	Data: Pre-trained language models (like BERT or GPT) fine-tuned on sentiment-labeled psychological datasets, such as EmotionLines or GoEmotions from Google.
	•	Techniques:
	•	Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Detection using NLP
	•	Time-series trend tracking to detect mood changes
	•	(Optional) Reinforcement learning to improve response strategies over time

A basic demo has been built using Python and HuggingFace Transformers, using mock data and simulated check-ins to track and graph emotional states over a week.

## Challenges

	Not a replacement for professional help. The system may misclassify emotions or give inappropriate suggestions in sensitive situations.
	•	Language-based sentiment detection can be biased or inaccurate, especially across cultures or neurodivergent expression.
	•	Privacy concerns: Users must trust the system with vulnerable data.
 
## What next?

	•	Integrate voice and multimodal inputs (like tone, pace, and even facial cues).
	•	Partner with teletherapy platforms for soft referrals.
	•	Support more languages and inclusive language understanding.

## Acknowledgments

	•	Pre-trained models from HuggingFace and datasets like GoEmotions from Google.
	•	Inspired by apps like Woebot, Wysa, and the concept of digital journaling.
